PROJECT: Penalty Kick Simulation
NAME:  Dimitri Charitou
CLASS: CPE 471
DATE:  June 13, 2019

HOW TO RUN: ./draw [lightingMode] [resourceDir]

	    lightingMode: 0 shades with Blinn-Phong and 1 shades with cel shading.
	    ./draw 0
	    ./draw 1

	    resourceDir: Redirect program to custom resource directory.

NOTES: - Light is located at world position (-40, 60, -30).
       - I bound the camera movement so it can not move outside of the skybox.
       - The ball collisions are implemented with Ordinary Differential Equation based physics.
       - The kicker will make a goal on every other reset and miss the other half.  When the kicker misses, notice how the ball bounces back.
	
FEATURES:
	   - The r key will reset the kicker and the ball.  If you miss the ball, you must press the r key to cleanly reset the scene, 
	     otherwise you will confuse the kicker's animations.
	   - The spacebar is pressed to start the kick and to kick the ball when you are close.
	   - The w key will move the camera forward along the current gaze.
	   - The s key will move the camera backward along the current gaze.
           - The d key will move the camera right along the current gaze.
           - The a key will move the camera left along the current gaze.
	   - Scrolling with the mouse pad will rotate the camera in place.
	   - The soccerball in front of the goalie is textured.
